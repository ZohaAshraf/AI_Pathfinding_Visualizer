## 🎓 Viva Voce Preparation

### Key Questions You Should Be Ready For:

1. **"Explain how BFS differs from DFS"**
   - Answer: BFS uses queue (FIFO), explores level-by-level, guarantees shortest path
   - DFS uses stack (LIFO), explores deeply, memory efficient but not optimal

2. **"Show me how to change the movement order"**
   - Location: GridEnvironment.get_neighbors() method
   - Modify the `directions` list

3. **"How do you handle dynamic obstacles?"**
   - Answer: Check each step, if obstacle on path, restart search
   - Location: handle_dynamic_obstacle() method

4. **"Explain your class structure"**
   - Answer: Node, GridEnvironment, SearchAlgorithm base, 6 algorithm classes, Visualizer
   - Design pattern: Strategy pattern for algorithms

5. **"Convert UCS to A* by adding a heuristic"**
   - Location: UCS.search() method
   - Add: `f_score = cost + heuristic(neighbor, target)`

6. **"Why use a priority queue for UCS?"**
   - Answer: Need to always expand lowest-cost node first
   - Priority queue gives O(log n) extraction of minimum

### Quick Modification Examples:

```python
# Change animation speed
ANIMATION_DELAY = 100  # milliseconds

# Disable dynamic obstacles
DYNAMIC_OBSTACLE_PROBABILITY = 0.0

# Change colors
COLORS['frontier'] = (0, 255, 0)  # Green frontier

# Different grid size
GRID_SIZE = 15  # Smaller grid

# Add Manhattan distance heuristic
def heuristic(node, target):
    return abs(node.row - target[0]) + abs(node.col - target[1])
```

## 📸 Screenshot Instructions for Report

The PDF report has placeholder sections for screenshots. You need to:

1. Run each algorithm (1-6)
2. For each algorithm, capture:
   - **Best case**: Target close, clear path
   - **Worst case**: Target far, complex obstacles
3. Insert screenshots in the report sections marked with placeholders

### How to Take Screenshots:

**During execution:**
- Let the algorithm complete
- Take screenshot of final state
- Shows: start, target, explored nodes, path

**Recommended tools:**
- Windows: Snipping Tool / Win+Shift+S
- Mac: Cmd+Shift+4
- Linux: Screenshot tool / Flameshot

### Screenshot Naming Convention:
```

bfs_worst.png
dfs_best.png

ucs_best.png
ucs_worst.png
dls_best.png
dls_worst.png

```

## 🔧 Customization Guide

### Easy Customizations:

1. **Grid Size**: Change `GRID_SIZE = 20` at top of file
2. **Animation Speed**: Adjust `ANIMATION_DELAY = 50`
3. **Colors**: Modify `COLORS` dictionary
4. **Obstacle Frequency**: Change `DYNAMIC_OBSTACLE_PROBABILITY`
5. **DLS Depth Limit**: Modify `limit` parameter when creating DLS

### Advanced Customizations:

1. **Add New Algorithm**: Create class inheriting from SearchAlgorithm
2. **Custom Maze**: Modify `create_sample_maze()` method
3. **Different Costs**: Change cost calculation in `get_neighbors()`
4. **Heuristics**: Add heuristic function to informed search

## 🎯 Testing Strategy

### Test Scenarios Included:

1. **Simple Environment** (test_pathfinder.py)
   - Small grid (15x15)
   - Simple obstacles
   - Clear path exists

2. **Complex Environment**
   - Full grid (20x20)
   - Maze-like obstacles
   - Difficult pathfinding

### Run All Tests:
```bash
python test_pathfinder.py
# Choose option 2: "Run All Tests"
```

### Quick Demo:
```bash
python test_pathfinder.py
# Choose option 1: "Quick Demo (BFS only)"
```

---

## 📊 Performance Expectations

### Typical Execution Times (20x20 grid):

- **BFS**: 3-5 seconds
- **DFS**: 1-8 seconds (varies greatly)
- **UCS**: 4-6 seconds
- **DLS**: 1-3 seconds (may fail)
- **IDDFS**: 5-7 seconds
- **Bidirectional**: 2-4 seconds (fastest)

### Nodes Expanded (approximate):

- **BFS**: 150-250 nodes
- **DFS**: 50-350 nodes (unpredictable)
- **UCS**: 140-220 nodes
- **DLS**: 50-150 nodes (if successful)
- **IDDFS**: 200-300 nodes
- **Bidirectional**: 80-150 nodes (most efficient)

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**"No module named pygame"**
```bash
pip install pygame
```

**"Window not responding"**
- Normal during algorithm execution
- Wait for completion or close

**"Path not found"**
- DLS may fail if depth limit too small
- Increase limit or use different algorithm

**"Slow animation"**
- Decrease ANIMATION_DELAY
- Use smaller grid size

**"Too fast to see"**
- Increase ANIMATION_DELAY
- Use larger grid for more steps
